function [X_norm, mu, sigma] = featureNormalize(X)
%FEATURENORMALIZE Normalizes the features in X 
%   FEATURENORMALIZE(X) returns a normalized version of X where
%   the mean value of each feature is 0 and the standard deviation
%   is 1. This is often a good preprocessing step to do when
%   working with learning algorithms.

mu = mean(X);
X_norm = bsxfun(@minus, X, mu);

sigma = std(X_norm);
X_norm = bsxfun(@rdivide, X_norm, sigma);

X_poly = zeros(numel(X), p);

% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: Given a vector X, return a matrix X_poly where the p-th 
%               column of X contains the values of X to the p-th power.

for i = 1:p
	X_poly(:,i) = X.^i;
